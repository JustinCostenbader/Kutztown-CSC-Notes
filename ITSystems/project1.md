### 1. What are the criteria of a better information system for business?

According to Kyle Duarte, there are five main criteria of a better information system: [1]
1. Functionality
    * Must use industry best practices
    * Must reduce data burden on users (i.e. users won't need to file and organize data manually)
    * Promote better decision making
    * Cost-effectiveness (For example: It was more cost effective for the New York Times to upload news articles online then to print thousands of physical copies.)
2. Usability
    * Correctness (meets all needs and specifications required for proper use)
    * User-friendly (Is it going to take a long time or a lot of effort for people to learn how to use the software?)
    * Ethics (Will the software cause any negative side effects?)
3. Operational
    * Reliability (if concurrent use of the system is required it should not fail during execution)
    * Efficiency (makes effective use of resources; for example: effective use of memory)
    * Security (user data needs to be secure from threats)
4. Revision
    * Maintainability (software maintenance should be easy)
    * Flexibility (changes within software should be easy to make and to deploy)
    * Testability (testing the software should be easy)
5. Scalability
    * Scalable (can handle additional users and more work in the future)
    * Accessible (can attain and use the software from multiple platforms or devices)
    * Modularity (separate parts that can be modified and tested independently... i.e. not a monolithic application)

### 2. How to create a better information system for business?

To create a better information system for business, Kyle Duarte says that you need to "Understand the Context". [1]
<br>
Firstly, you need a problem and a problem statement.
<br>
We need to know how the IS could solve the problem at hand, who the IS would benefit, and the resources that are necessary to develop and implement the IS.

### 3. What are the routine tasks to fulfill to keep the information systems better?

Some routine tasks to fulfill the quality of the information systems would include, regularly checking data quality, focusing on robust software solutions, and quickly patching bugs and issues after deployment.
<br>
IT workers would need to check the data for accuracy, completeness, relevence, accessibility, and consistency. [1]
<br>
Focusing on robust software solutions ensures that in the future the software will continue to be flexible and easy to make revisions upon.


### Current Kutztown STEAMworks business procedure (Problem)
Currently, to 3d print at the Kutztown University STEAMworks you must bring your 3d print file on a usb drive or send it attached in an email to the makerspace staff. 
One issue is that not every student knows the name of the staffworkers and therefore, could not email them.
Another underlying issue is that even after bringing your 3d print file on a usb, the makerspace may not offer the color you want, the cost may be more than you expected to pay, or it may take longer to print then what you require.

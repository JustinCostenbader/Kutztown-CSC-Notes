Project 4 (Vowels) Summarized Instructions:

- Must store vowel counts in an array and output them after all vowels have been processed (NOT as they are found).
- Use symbolic constants to set fixed values (array sizes).
- Just search for lower case vowels and disregard "y" for this project.
- Use Irvine32 procedures for input/output display.

  Main PROC:
  - Prompt user for character string (up to 100 characters).
  - Read and store the user string.
  - Call "CountChars" procedure that will count the number of occurences for each vowel.
  - Store the total for each vowel in an array.

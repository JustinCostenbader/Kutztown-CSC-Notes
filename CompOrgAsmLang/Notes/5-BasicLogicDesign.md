# Basic Logic Design

## Sequential vs. Combinatorial
- Combinatorial Circuits
  - Always get the same result for a given set of inputs
- Sequential Circuits
  - Information is stored
  - Output depends on both current inputs and internally stored state(s)
  - A "counter" is a good example
    - "Current count" is stored
    - next value depends on the current count
  - Important for making memories and state machines
  - Important for managing information flow

 ## Basic Latch
 - A **Latch** is a circuit that stores one bit of information
 - Inputs
   - Data - the value to store
   - Enable (or Clock) - data is stored when active
   - Output - the presently stored value
- Various types
  - SR latch
  - D latch
  - JK latch
